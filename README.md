# Welcome to my (OLD) Portfolio Site!

Using Node.js and Express, I created a multi-page layout version of my previous portfolio site. 

This site was created strictly for practice purposes as I continue to develop my skills in web development.

## List of Techniques Used

1.	Bootstrap was used to create the responsive layout.
2.	Node.JS is used on the back-end to enable a more dynamic rendering of the site, as well as in the future for "Contact Form" purposes (WIP).
3.	Express was used in tandem with Node as the back-end framework.
